# NN_on_MNISTDATABASE

This project contains the code needed to produce the results presented in simulatation_presention.key and was developed as part of the mandatory 
requirements to pass the Biological Physics exam @UniPD during the a.y. 20/21. In particular, the assignment for this project was to develop, train 
and test a simple neural network to recognise handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using the back-propagation algorithm. 
The following are some useful files:
- training.mlapp is a MATLAB App Package that allows you to control the execution of the software;
- train.m is a simple text file that contains the code to develop and train your neural network;
- test.m is a simple text file that contains the code to test you neural network.
